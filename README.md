 A touch typing game that is designed to help you get better at typing. 
 
 So what I did was create an array for all my sentences and saved that as a variable on the window. I then split the sentences and listened for user input once the sentence appeared on the screen.
 
 It was definitely hard going and there are a few little bugs in the game itself, one of which is a bug after reset where after a correct sentence pressing enter will now cause you to lose the game. It is considering it as an early press of enter/return. 
 
 I had trouble getting a win condition and adding new levels. New levels are definitely something I may add in the future. Its a great base to have started with and I will definitely come back to this in the future.
