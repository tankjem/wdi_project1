Type for your life
 
 A touch typing game that is designed to help you get better at typing. 
 
 I did not use OOP for this project and I kind of wish I had... But once I got going I started to find the coding easier and easier.
 
 So what I did was create an array for all my sentences and saved that as a variable on the window. I then split the sentences and listened for user input once the sentence appeared on the screen.
 
 It was definitely hard going and there are a few little bugs in the game itself, but are barely notciable.
 
 Ihad trouble getting a win condition and adding new levels. New levels are definitely something i may add in the future...
